(** Unicode text segmentation.

    [Uuseg] segments Unicode text. It implements the locale
    independent Unicode text segmentation algorithms to detect
    grapheme cluster, word and sentence boundaries and the Unicode
    line breaking algorithm to detect line break opportunities.

    The module is independent from any IO mechanism or Unicode text
    data structure and it can process text without a complete
    in-memory representation.

    The supported Unicode version
    is determined by the {!unicode_version} value.

    Consult the {{!basics}basics}, {{!limits}limitations} and
    {{!examples}examples} of use.

(** {1:limits Limitations}

    A [`Grapheme_cluster] segmenter will always consume only a small
    bounded amount of memory on any text. Other segmenters will also
    do so on non-degenerate text, but it's possible to feed them with
    input that will make them buffer an arbitrary amount of
    characters. *)

(** {1:basics Basics}

    A segmenter is a stateful filter that inputs a sequence of characters
    and outputs the same sequence except characters are interleaved
    with [`Boundary] values whenever the segmenter detects a boundary.

    The function {!create} returns a new segmenter for a given boundary
    type:
    {[
      let words = Uuseg.create `Word
    ]}
    To add characters to the sequence to segment, call {!add} on
    [words] with [`Uchar _]. To end the sequence call {!add} on [words]
    with [`End]. The segmented sequence of characters is returned character
    by character, interleaved with [`Boundary] values at the appropriate
    places, by the successive calls to {!add}.

    The client and the segmenter must wait on each other to limit
    internal buffering: each time the client adds to the sequence
    by calling {!add} with [`Uchar] or [`End] it must continue to
    call {!add} with [`Await] until the segmenter returns [`Await]
    or [`End]. In practice this leads to the following kind of control flow:
    {[
      let rec add acc v = match Uuseg.add words v with
      | `Uchar u -> add (`Uchar u :: acc) `Await
      | `Boundary -> add (`B :: acc) `Await
      | `Await | `End -> acc
    ]}
    For example to segment the sequence <[U+0041], [U+0020], [U+0042]>
    (["a b"]) to a list of characters interleaved with [`B] values on word
    boundaries we can write:
    {[
      let uchar = `Uchar (Uchar.of_int u)
      let seq = [uchar 0x0041; uchar 0x0020; uchar 0x0042]
      let seq_words = List.rev (add (List.fold_left add [] seq) `End)
    ]}
*)

(** {1:examples Examples}

    [utf_8_segments seg s] is the list of UTF-8 encoded [seg] segments of
    the UTF-8 encoded string [s].

    {[
      let utf_8_segments seg s =
        let flush_segment buf acc =
          let segment = Buffer.contents buf in
          Buffer.clear buf; if segment = "" then acc else segment :: acc
        in
        let rec add buf acc segmenter v = match Uuseg.add segmenter v with
        | `Uchar u -> Buffer.add_utf_8_uchar buf u; add buf acc segmenter `Await
        | `Boundary -> add buf (flush_segment buf acc) segmenter `Await
        | `Await | `End -> acc
        in
        let rec loop buf acc s i max segmenter =
          if i > max then flush_segment buf (add buf acc segmenter `End) else
          let dec = String.get_utf_8_uchar s i in
          let acc = add buf acc segmenter (`Uchar (Uchar.utf_decode_uchar dec)) in
          loop buf acc s (i + Uchar.utf_decode_length dec) max segmenter
        in
        let buf = Buffer.create 42 in
        let segmenter = Uuseg.create seg in
        List.rev (loop buf [] s 0 (String.length s - 1) segmenter)
    ]}

    Note that this function can be derived directly from
    {!Uuseg_string.fold_utf_8}. *)
